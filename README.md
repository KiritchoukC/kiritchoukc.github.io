### Clément - 26 - Belgium

I've started coding at 16 with Java, Html & CSS.

At 18, I took classes of Computer Sciences. I learned C, Javascript, VBA, C# and hardware.

At 22, I got a job as a .Net Developer working. It's been more than 3 years and the more I use C#, the more I love it and I still discover new things everyday.

During these past years, I've worked with a lot of different technologies...
